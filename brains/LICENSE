We are making the MRI MS DB available to the research community free of charge.
If you use this database in your research, we kindly ask that you reference the papers listed below:

Further download information for the database may be obtained by contacting Prof. Christos P. Loizou (panloicy@logosnet.cy.net).
Pre-prints of the publication papers are also available upon request, or can be downlaoded for personal use from the
website of the Laboratory of eHealth of the University of Cyprus, at:

MRI MS DB Description:
In the IMT-Segmentation folder there are 38 folders representing data for each patient 38patients).
In each patient folder we have:
1) MRI TIFF Images from first and second examination (0 months, 6-12 months)
2) Lesion segmentations (*.plq files). The delineation/s can be loaded into matlab i.e load(file.plq, '-.mat'); Then points can be drawn on the image.

%How to load the point deliniations into MATLAB and plot them to the image.
load('IM_00031_1.plq','-mat');
a=imread('IM_00031.tif');
figure, imshow(a), hold on, plot(yi,xi, 'LineWidth', 3), hold off;
